    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.  </li>
        <li>Guanciale: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you cant find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Three large eggs add richness and flavor.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
